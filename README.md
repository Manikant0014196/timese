# Time Series Analysis With Python
This is a series of lessons on time series analysis with Python programming. Originally it was for night training sessions for new-hire in my previous institutions (hedge fund), all quantitative analysts and macro analysts are supposed to have more than working knowlege of time series modelling, so this training session will discuss and demonstrate the underlying mathematical foundations, modelling and Python-related skills. 

All trainees are required to have solid knowledge of <a href='https://github.com/MacroAnalyst/Linear_Algebra_With_Python'>linear algebra</a>, <a href='https://github.com/MacroAnalyst/Probability_Theory'>probability theory</a>, <a href='https://github.com/MacroAnalyst/Basic_Statistics_With_Python'>statistics</a> and <a href='https://github.com/MacroAnalyst/Basic_Econometrics_With_Python'>basic econometrics</a>. All analysts are researchers too, with these knowledge, you can freely read institutional or academic researches and internalize them into your own analystical framework.
